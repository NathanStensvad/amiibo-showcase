# Amiibo Showcase

The Amiibo Showcase pulls every figure amiibo from the API and puts it in a downloadable picture. Show off your favorite amiibos!

## Motivation

If you've ever played any old Super Smash Brothers game, you may have seen the trophy hoard. In the game, you could collect trophies and see your entire trophy collection displayed on screen. When I saw that an Amiibo API existed, I knew I had to make a showcase for it.
